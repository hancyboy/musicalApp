     <h1><b>Perfect lyrics</b></h1>
     <p>
         
Don't feel like putting makeup on my cheeks<br>
Do what I wanna<br>
Love every single part of my body<br>
Top to the bottom<br>
I'm not a supermodel from a magazine, mmh-mmh<br>
I'm okay with not being perfect<br>
<br>
'Cause that's perfect to me<br>
'Cause that's perfect to me<br>
'Cause that's perfect to me<br>

No matter where I go, everybody stares at me<br>
Not into fancy clothes, I'm rocking baggy jeans<br>
Getting too close for comfort, but comfort is what I need<br>
So I eat my body weight in chocolate and ice cream<br>
Maybe I bite my nails and don't think before I speak<br>
Don't fit in any crowd, don't ever get much sleep<br>
I wish my legs were bigger, bigger than New York City<br>
And I'll love who I want to love, 'cause this love is gender free<br>
<br>
Don't feel like putting makeup on my cheeks<br>
Do what I wanna<br>
Love every single part of my body<br>
Top to the bottom<br>
I'm not a supermodel from a magazine, no<br>
I'm okay with not being perfect<br>
<br>
'Cause that's perfect to me<br>
'Cause that's perfect to me<br>
'Cause that's perfect to me<br>
<br>
Sometimes I wake up late and don't even brush my teeth, uh<br>
Just wanna stuff my face with leftover mac and cheese<br>
You know I get depressed, are you impressed with my honesty?<br>
So I wear what I wanna 'cause I'm cool with what's underneath, hm<br>
I wanna kiss someone that I'll never see again<br>
I wanna go somewhere and go there with all my friends<br>
I wanna take my family to go and see Eminem<br>
'Cause my sister's been in love with him since like we were ten<br>
<br>
Don't feel like putting makeup on my cheeks<br>
Do what I wanna<br>
Love every single part of my body<br>
Top to the bottom<br>
I'm not a supermodel from a magazine<br>
I'm okay with not being perfect<br>
