      <br>
 Walking down 29th and park <br>
I saw you in another's arms <br>
Only a month we've been apart <br>
You look happier <br>
<br>
Saw you walk inside a bar <br>
He said something to make you laugh <br>
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours <br>
Yeah, you look happier, you do <br>
<br>
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you <br>
But ain't nobody love you like I do <br>
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby <br>
If you're moving on with someone new <br>
<br>
'Cause baby you look happier, you do <br>
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too <br>
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth <br>
But I know I was happier with you <br>
<br>
Sat on the corner of the room <br>
Everything's reminding me of you <br>
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself you're happier <br>
Aren't you? <br>
<br>
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you <br>
But ain't nobody need you like I do <br>
I know that there's others that deserve you <br>
But my darling, I am still in love with you <br>
<br>
But I guess you look happier, you do <br>
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too <br>
I could try to smile to hide the truth <br>
But I know I was happier with you <br>
<br>
Baby, you look happier, you do <br>
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new <br>
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do <br>
Just know that I'll be waiting here for you <br>
