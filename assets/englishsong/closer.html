    <p>
        Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you<br>
I drink too much, and that's an issue, but I'm okay<br>
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them<br>
But I hope I never see them again<br>
I know it breaks your heart<br>
Moved to the city in a broke-down car, and<br>
Four years, no calls<br>
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar, and<br>
I-I-I can't stop<br>
No, I-I-I can't stop<br>
So, baby, pull me closer<br>
In the back seat of your Rover<br>
That I know you can't afford<br>
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder<br>
Pull the sheets right off the corner<br>
Of that mattress that you stole<br>
From your roommate back in Boulder<br>
We ain't ever getting older<br>
We ain't ever getting older<br>
We ain't ever getting older<br>
You look as good as the day I met you<br>
I forget just why I left you, I was insane<br>
Stay and play that Blink-182 song<br>
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay<br>
I know it breaks your heart<br>
Moved to the city in a broke-down car, and<br>
Four years, no call<br>
Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar, and<br>
I-I-I can't stop<br>
No, I-I-I can't stop<br>
So, baby, pull me closer<br>
In the back seat of your Rover<br>
That I know you can't afford<br>
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder<br>
Pull the sheets right off the corner<br>
Of that mattress that you stole<br>
From your roommate back in Boulder<br>
We ain't ever getting older<br>
We ain't ever getting older<br>
We ain't ever getting older<br>
So, baby, pull me closer<br>
In the back seat of your Rover<br>
That I know you can't afford<br>
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder<br>
Pull the sheets right off the corner<br>
Of that mattress that you stole<br>
From your roommate back in Boulder<br>
We ain't ever getting older<br>
We ain't ever getting older<br>
No, we ain't ever getting older<br>
We ain't ever getting older<br>
No, we ain't ever getting older<br>
We ain't ever getting older<br>
We ain't ever getting older<br>
We ain't ever getting older<br>
No, we ain't ever getting older<br>
We ain't ever getting older<br>
No, we ain't ever getting older<br>
