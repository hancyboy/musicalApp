    <h1><b>You Are The Reason-Calum Scott, Leona Lewis</b></h1>
    <p>
        There goes my heart beating<br>
'Cause you are the reason<br>
I'm losing my sleep<br>
Please come back now<br>
And there goes my mind racing<br>
And you are the reason<br>
That I'm still breathing<br>
I'm hopeless now<br>
I'd climb every mountain<br>
And swim every ocean<br>
Just to be with you<br>
And fix what I've broken<br>
Oh, 'cause I need you to see<br>
That you are the reason<br>
There goes my hands shaking<br>
And you are the reason<br>
My heart keeps bleeding<br>
I need you now<br>
And if I could turn back the clock<br>
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark<br>
I'd spend every hour, of every day<br>
Keeping you safe<br>
And I'd climb every mountain<br>
And swim every ocean<br>
Just to be with you<br>
And fix what I've broken<br>
Oh, 'cause I need you to see<br>
That you are the reason<br>
I don't wanna fight no more<br>
I don't wanna hide no more<br>
I don't wanna cry no more<br>
Come back I need you to hold me (you are the reason)<br>
Be a little closer now<br>
Just a little closer now<br>
Come a little closer<br>
I need you to hold me tonight<br>
I'd climb every mountain<br>
And swim every ocean<br>
Just to be with you<br>
And fix what I've broken<br>
'Cause I need you to see<br>
That you are the reason<br>
