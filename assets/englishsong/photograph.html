Loving can hurt <br>
Loving can hurt sometimes <br>
But it's the only thing <br>
That I know <br>
<br>
And when it gets hard <br>
You know it can get hard sometimes <br>
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive <br>
<br>
We keep this love in a photograph <br>
We make these memories for ourselves <br>
Where our eyes are never closing <br>
Hearts are never broken <br>
And time's forever frozen still <br>
<br>
So you can keep me <br>
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans <br>
Holdin' me closer 'til our eyes meet <br>
You won't ever be alone <br>
Wait for me to come home <br> 
<br>
Loving can heal <br>
Loving can mend your soul <br>
And is the only thing <br>
That I know, know <br>
I swear it will get easier <br>
Remember that with every piece of ya <br>
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die <br>
<br>
We keep this love in a photograph <br>
We make these memories for ourselves <br>
Where our eyes are never closing <br>
Hearts were never broken <br>
And time's forever frozen still <br>
<br>
So you can keep me <br>
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans <br>
Holdin' me closer 'til our eyes meet <br>
You won't ever be alone <br>
<br>
And if you hurt me <br>
Well that's okay baby only words bleed <br>
Inside these pages you just hold me <br>
And I won't ever let you go <br>
Wait for me to come home <br>
<br>
Wait for me to come home <br>
Wait for me to come home <br>
Wait for me to come home <br>
<br>
Oh, you can fit me <br>
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16 <br>
Next to your heartbeat where I should be <br>
Keep it deep within your soul <br>
<br>
And if you hurt me <br>
Well that's okay baby only words bleed <br>
Inside these pages you just hold me <br>
And I won't ever let you go <br>
<br>
When I'm away <br>
I will remember how you kissed me <br>
Under the lamppost back on 6th street <br>
Hearing you whisper through the phone <br>
Wait for me to come home <br>
    </p>
