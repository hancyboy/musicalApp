        We don't talk anymore<br>
We don't talk anymore<br>
We don't talk anymore<br>
Like we used to do<br>
We don't love anymore<br>
What was all of it for?<br>
Oh, we don't talk anymore<br>
Like we used to do<br>
I just heard you found the one you've been looking<br>
You've been looking for<br>
I wish I would have known that wasn't me<br>
'Cause even after all this time, I still wonder<br>
Why I can't move on<br>
Just the way you did so easily<br>
Don't wanna know<br>
Kind of dress you're wearing tonight<br>
If he's holding onto you so tight<br>
The way I did before<br>
I overdosed<br>
Should've known your love was a game<br>
Now I can't get you out of my brain<br>
Oh, it's such a shame<br>
That we don't talk anymore<br>
We don't talk anymore<br>
We don't talk anymore<br>
Like we used to do<br>
We don't love anymore<br>
What was all of it for?<br>
Oh, we don't talk anymore<br>
Like we used to do<br>
I just hope you're lying next to somebody<br>
Who knows how to love you like me<br>
There must be a good reason that you're gone<br>
Every now and then I think you might want me to<br>
Come show up at your door<br>
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong<br>
Don't wanna know<br>
If you're looking into her eyes<br>
If she's holding onto you so tight<br>
The way I did before<br>
I overdosed<br>
Should've known your love was a game<br>
Now I can't get you out of my brain<br>
Oh, it's such a shame<br>
That we don't talk anymore<br>
We don't talk anymore<br>
We don't talk anymore<br>
Like we used to do<br>
We don't love anymore<br>
What was all of it for?<br>
Oh, we don't talk anymore<br>
Like we used to do<br>
Like we used to do<br>
Don't wanna know<br>
Kind of dress you're wearing tonight<br>
If he's giving it to you just right<br>
The way I did before<br>
I overdosed<br>
Should've known your love was a game<br>
Now I can't get you out of my brain<br>
Oh, it's such a shame<br>
That we don't talk anymore<br>
We don't talk anymore<br>
We don't talk anymore<br>
Like we used to do<br>
We don't love anymore<br>
What was all of it for?<br>
Oh, we don't talk anymore<br>
Like we used to do<br>
We don't talk anymore (don't wanna know)<br>
Kind of dress you're wearing tonight (oh)<br>
If he's holding onto you so tight (oh)<br>
The way I did before<br>
We don't talk anymore (I overdosed)<br>
Should've known your love was a game (oh)<br>
Now I can't get you out of my brain (whoa)<br>
Oh, it's such a shame<br>
That we don't talk anymore<br>
