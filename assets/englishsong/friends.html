        Ooh ooh, ooh ooh<br>
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh<br>
You say you love me, I say you crazy<br>
We're nothing more than friends<br>
You're not my lover, more like a brother<br>
I known you since we were like ten, yeah<br>
Don't mess it up, talking that shit<br>
Only gonna push me away, that's it<br>
When you say you love me, that make me crazy<br>
Here we go again<br>
Don't go look at me with that look in your eye<br>
You really ain't going away without a fight<br>
You can't be reasoned with, I'm done being polite<br>
I've told you one, two, three, four, five, six thousand times<br>
Haven't I made it obvious?<br>
Haven't I made it clear?<br>
Want me to spell it out for you?<br>
F-R-I-E-N-D-S<br>
Haven't I made it obvious?<br>
Haven't I made it clear?<br>
Want me to spell it out for you?<br>
F-R-I-E-N-D-S<br>
F-R-I-E-N-D-S<br>
Have you got no shame? You lookingâ€¦<br>
