        I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath<br>
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess<br>
So I sat quietly, agreed politely<br>
I guess that I forgot I had a choice<br>
I let you push me past the breaking point<br>
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything<br>
You held me down, but I got up (hey)<br>
Already brushing off the dust<br>
You hear my voice, you hear that sound<br>
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground<br>
You held me down, but I got up (hey)<br>
Get ready 'cause I've had enough<br>
I see it all, I see it now<br>
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter<br>
Dancing through the fire<br>
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar<br>
Louder, louder than a lion<br>
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar<br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
You're gonna hear me roar<br>
Now I'm floatin' like a butterfly<br>
Stinging like a bee, I earned my stripes<br>
I went from zero, to my own hero<br>
You held me down, but I got up (hey)<br>
Already brushing off the dust<br>
You hear my voice, you hear that sound<br>
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground<br>
You held me down, but I got up (hey)<br>
Get ready 'cause I've had enough<br>
I see it all, I see it now<br>
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter<br>
Dancing through the fire<br>
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar<br>
Louder, louder than a lion<br>
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar<br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
You're gonna hear me roar<br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (you'll hear me roar)<br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
You're gonna hear me roar<br>
Roar, roar, roar, roar, roar<br>
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter<br>
Dancing through the fire<br>
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar<br>
Louder, louder than a lion<br>
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar<br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (yeah)<br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
You're gonna hear me roar<br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (you'll hear me roar)<br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
You're gonna hear me roar<br>
